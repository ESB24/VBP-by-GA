heuristics for the Vector Bin Packing problem, where we are required to
pack n items represented by d-dimensional vectors, into as few bins of
size 1d each as possible. We systematically study variants of the First Fit
Decreasing (FFD) algorithm that have been proposed for this problem.
Inspired by bad instances for FFD-type algorithms, we propose new ge-
ometric heuristics that run nearly as fast as FFD for reasonable values
of n and d.
We report on empirical evaluations of the FFD-based, as well as the
new heuristics on large families of distributions. We identify which FFD
variants work best in most cases and show that our new heuristics usually
outperform FFD-based heuristics and can sometimes reduce the number
of bins used by up to ten percent. Further, in all cases where we were
able to compute the optimal solution we found our new heuristics within
few percent of optimal. We conclude that these new heuristics are an
excellent alternative to FFD-based heuristics and are prime candidates
to be used in practice.},

  abstract   = {This paper describes a novel approach making use of genetic algorithms to find optimal solutions for multi-dimensional vector bin packing problems with the goal to improve cloud resource allocation and Virtual Machines (VMs) consolidation. Two algorithms, namely Combinatorial Ordering First-Fit Genetic Algorithm (COFFGA) and Combinatorial Ordering Next Fit Genetic Algorithm (CONFGA) have been developed for that and combined. The proposed hybrid algorithm targets to minimise the total number of running servers and resources wastage per server. The solutions obtained by the new algorithms are compared with latest solutions from literature. The results show that the proposed algorithm COFFGA outperforms other previous multi-dimension vector bin packing heuristics such as Permutation Pack (PP), First Fit (FF) and First Fit Decreasing (FFD) by 4%, 34%, and 39%, respectively. It also achieved better performance than the existing genetic algorithm for multi-capacity resources virtual machine consolidation (RGGA) in terms of performance and robustness. A thorough explanation for the improved performance of the newly proposed algorithm is given. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract   = {We study the problem of optimising the provisioning of collections of virtual machines (VMs) having different placement constraints (e.g., security and anti-collocation) and characteristics (e.g., memory and disk capacity), given a set of physical machines (PMs) with known specifications, in order to achieve the objective of maximising an IaaS cloud provider's revenue. We propose two approaches. The first is based on the formulation of the problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, the solution to which provides an optimal VM placement. The second approach is a heuristic based on classifying the requests into different categories and satisfying the constraints in a particular order using a first lit decreasing (FFD) algorithm for multi-dimensional vector bin packing problem. Given a model of VM placement constraints, offered resources and requests with multiple VM types, both approaches devise a placement plan in a way that maximizes revenue, having due regard both to customer requirements and PM capacities. We evaluate the relative performance of the solutions by means of numerical experiments. The results suggest the optimal solution is not practical for medium to large problems, but it is encouraging that the placement plans of the heuristic are close to those of the optimal solution for smaller problem sizes. We use the heuristic to generate results for large scale placement problems; experiments suggest that it is practical in terms of its runtime efficiency and can provide an effective means of online VM-to-PM mapping.},
